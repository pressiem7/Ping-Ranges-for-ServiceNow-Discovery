# Class-B-Ping-Ranges-for-ServiceNow-Discovery
This project pings a /16 range and records if there are hosts in a particular /24. If there are hosts it writes output to a CSV in the format that SN accepts for discovery. If there are not hosts it simply moves on. It's designed to work from Windows but could be easily altered for a Unix host.
